            At <strong>StyleLane</strong>, we believe that inventory management should be as sophisticated as the
            fashion it tracks. Founded in 2024, our mission is to empower retailers with a cloud-native platform that
            bridges the gap between store floor operations and global supplier networks.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            In Phase 1 of our journey, we have focused on building a robust, manual foundation. We provide
            <strong>Administrators</strong> with complete oversight, <strong>Store Managers</strong> with agile
            inventory controls, and <strong>Suppliers</strong> with real-time visibility into the products they provide.
        </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--color-text); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The StyleLane Philosophy</h3>
            "Efficiency is not just about speed; it's about clarity. When managers know exactly what's on the shelf, and
            suppliers know exactly what's needed, the entire fashion ecosystem thrives."
        </div>

        <p>
            As we move forward, StyleLane will continue to evolve, integrating advanced automation and predictive
            analytics to ensure that your style never waits on stock.
